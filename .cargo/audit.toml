# IMPORTANT:
# These advisories only apply when the optional `transport_mqttac`
# feature is explicitly enabled. With default features, the affected
# dependency tree is not built and is not present in the final binary.
#
# The following advisories are triggered by the optional
# `transport_mqttac` feature via the `mqtt-async-client` crate.
#
# These vulnerabilities originate from its pinned TLS stack:
#   mqtt-async-client
#     → tokio-rustls
#       → rustls 0.19
#         → ring / webpki
#
# They cannot be resolved locally without forking or replacing
# the upstream dependency.
#
# This crate provides an alternative MQTT transport based on
# `rumqttc` (`transport_rumqttc` feature), which does NOT rely
# on this TLS stack and is the recommended secure option.
#
# The affected transport remains feature-gated and is not
# enabled by default.
